Hello,

I am ready with the information you requested. However, before we proceed, I just would like to know if I will have to pay for shipping at all, or if there are any fees associated with this process. Please let me know, thank you.

The steps it takes to reproduce the issue are as follows:
Put the headset on. The defect for the left lens is towards the bottom right, so you will need to fix your gaze on something through that area of the lens, preferably text or an image. Close your right eye.  While looking at text or an image through the bottom right part of the lens, turn your head a little from side to side repeatedly while keeping your gaze fixed and you should notice a ripple effect on the text or image you are looking at. I will attach a picture that shows the areas you need to look through on the lenses to see their corresponding defects.
