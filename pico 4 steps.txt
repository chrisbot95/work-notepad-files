The steps it takes to reproduce the issue are as follows:
Put the headset on. Fix your eyes on text or images on a flat wall or surface in the virtual world. Close your right eye and fix the gaze of your left eye through the bottom right area of the left lens onto text or an image in the virtual world. You can do this step for the right lens as well; the defect area on the right lens is towards the bottom left. I will attach a picture that shows the exact areas I am referring to. When you are looking at text or an image, turn your head a little from side to side repeatedly while keeping your gaze fixed and you should notice a ripple effect.
