Dear Geri-Lynn and Noreen,

Please accept this letter as my formal resignation from my position as Coding Coach. My last day will be on Saturday, May 4th. I have taken on more responsibilities and the time that I can spend planning lessons has unfortunately become too limited.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I greatly appreciate the time that I have spent at The Coder School and the connections I have made along the way. I think very highly of my coworkers and hope to stay in touch with everyone.

Please let me know how I can help ensure a smooth transition.

Sincerely,
Christopher Brady
